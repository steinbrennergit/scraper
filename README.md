# scraper

This application would scrape the webpages of Bulbapedia, a popular Pokemon resource, in order to gather data regarding the first 151 Pokemon and save to .csv files. This was used for the project located in https://github.com/steinbrennergit/mysql-pd in order to easily import the Pokemon data into our MySQL database.
